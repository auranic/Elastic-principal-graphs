# Elastic principal graphs
Matlab implementation of Elastic Principal Graphs (ElPiGraph) method. 

To overview the features of the method, make ElPiGraph working directory, and execute

     setallpaths; 
     basicCodeTest;

Basic self-contained formal description of ElPiGraph can be found [here](https://github.com/auranic/Elastic-principal-graphs/blob/master/ElPiGraph_Methods.pdf). 

Principal graphs are graphs that are embedded into a high-dimensional space and minimize the distance to the data points, while maximizing some regular properties.

Elastic principal graphs are based on minimization of the energy potential containing three parts :

### ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U%20%3D%20MSE%20&plus;%20%5Clambda%20U_E%20&plus;%20%5Cmu%20U_R)

where MSE is the mean squared error of data approximation, ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U_E) - is the sum of squared edge lengths, ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U_R) is a term minimizing the deviation of the principal graph embedment from harmonicity (generalization of linearity), ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clambda) ,![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu)  are coefficients of regularization.

The structure of the graph is computed by an optimal application of a sequence of graph transformations, using operations from predefined graph grammar.
The simplest graph grammar "Bisect an edge", "Add a node to a node" leads to construction of a principal tree.

# Organization of the code

## Folders:

ElPiGraph/core_algorithm 		- contains the core MATLAB code of the algorithm (self-contained)

ElPiGraph/core_algorithm_java	- old MATLAB wrapper of the Java code for ElPiGraph

ElPiGraph/docs			- some documentation on the method and the code

ElPiGraph/examples		- some example applications of the method

ElPiGraph/simulations		- code generating synthetic datasets (e.g., with known branching topology)

ElPiGraph/test_code		- testing critical parts of the code (not needed for the package use)

ElPiGraph/test_data		- example datasets 

ElPiGraph/utils			- utility functions for manipulating data and the graph (e.g., projection function)

ElPiGraph/visualization		- utility functions used for visualizing the results of the method application (such as applying metro map layout of the principal tree)

MasterApplet 			- Java applet implementing several methods for constructing complex data approximators including elastic principal trees. The applet can be run as a standalone jar file.


## Functions in the root "ElPiGraph" folder:

computeElasticPrincipalCircle.m		- computes closed elastic principal curve with a given number of nodes

computeElasticPrincipalCurve.m          - computes elastic principal curve with a given number of nodes

computeElasticPrincipalGraph.m		- computes elastic principal graph for a dataset with a given number of nodes and defined set of grammars (principal tree grammar by default)

computeRobustElasticPrincipalGraph.m		- computes robust version of elastic principal graph for a dataset with a given number of nodes and defined set of grammars (principal tree grammar by default)

setallpaths.m				- set all paths to other folders (needed if some functions are called directly, bypassing the root folder "computeElasticPrincipalXXX.m" functions)
