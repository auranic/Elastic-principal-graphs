    = ElPrincGraph(X, NumNodes, Lambda, Mu, varargin)
% This function constructs a principal tree with NumNodes for a dataset X,
% with elasticities for edges Lamda and Elasticities for stars Mu
%
% Outputs
%   np is positions of empbedded nodes.
%   em is elastic matrix of the best selected new graph.
%   ReportTable is structure with 16 fields:
%       BARCODE is barcode in form ...S4|S3||N, where N is number of
%           nodes, S3 is number of three stars, S4 (5,...) is number of
%           four (five,...) stars.
%       ENERGY is total energy of graph embedment (ENERGY = MSE + UE + UR)
%       NNODES is number of nodes.
%       NEDGES is number of edges (NEDGES = NNODES - 1).
%       NRIBS is number of two stars (nodes with two otherr connected nodes). 
%       NSTARS is number of stars with 3 and more leaves (nodes connected
%           with central node).  
%       NRAYS2 is sum of rays minus doubled number of nodes.

%           quality. 
%       MSEP is mean square error for projections to edge.
%       FVE is fraction of explained variance. This value always between 0
%           and 1. Greater value means higher quality of data approximation.
%       FVEP is fraction variance unexplained for projections to edge.
%       UE is elastic energy for edges stretching.
%       UR is elastic energy of deviation from harmonicity.

%Inputs
%   X - is the n-by-m data matrix. Each row corresponds to one data point.
%   NumNodes maximal number of nodes in graph.
%   Lambda is edge elasticity potential
%   Mu is star elasticity potential
%   varargin contains Name, Value pairs. Names can be: 
%   'InitNodePositions' is k-by-m matrix of the initial tree node positions.
%   'InitElasticMatrix' is initial elastic matrix: k-by-k symmetric matrix
%       describing the connectivity and the elastic properties of the
%       graph. Star elasticities (mu coefficients) are presented on the
%       main diagonal (non-zero entries only for star centers), and the
%       edge elasticity moduli are presented out of diagonal. 
%   'verbose' with 1/0 is to display/hide the energy values at each
%       iteration and in the end of the process. 
%   'PointWeights' with n-by-1 vector of data point weights
%   'GrowGrammars' is cell array of string which contain grammar names:
%       'addnode2node'      adds a node to each graph node
%       'bisectedge'        adds nodt to the middle of each edge
%   'ShrinkGrammars' is cell array of string which contain grammar names:

%       'shrinkedge'        removes edge and glues two ends of this edge
%   'ComputeMSEP' with 1/0 is indicator of calculation of the projections
%       not into nearest node but onto nearest edge.

%       principal graphs (see https://github.com/auranic/Elastic-principal-graphs/wiki/Robust-principal-graphs)
%   'MaxMmorySize' with integer number which is maximum memory size for the
%       block of the distance matrix when partition the data. This means
%       that maximal number of simultaneously processed data points is not
%       greater than MaxBlockSize/k, where k is number of nodes.
%   'LocalSearch' specifies local test for optimizing only a subset of the
%       nodes. Integer number defines radius of neghbourhood to use.
%   'MaxNumberOfIterations' with integer number which is maximum number of
%       iterations for EM algorithm. 
%   'eps' with real number which is minimal relative change in the node
%       positions to be considered the graph embedded (convergence criteria)
