%computeElasticPrincipalGraph calculate elastic principal graph. 
%If grammar parameters 'GrowGrammar' and 'ShrinkGrammar' are not specified
%then by default the algorithm constructs a principal tree with default
%elasticity coefficients (Lambda=0.01,Mu=0.1)

%Theory and some examples of computeElasticPrincipalTree usage can be found

%
%Usage
%   [NodePositions, Edges] = computeElasticPrincipalGraph(data, NumNodes,
%   ParameterSet) returns 
%       NodePositions is k-by-m matrix of coordinates of k nodes in m
%           dimensional space for n-by-m matrix data (each row of matrix
%           contains one observation) and at most NumNodes nodes k.
%       Edges is k-by-2 matrix of integers. Edges(i,1) and Edges(i,2)
%           specify numbers of two vertex of i-th edge.
%   Input features:
%       data is n-by-m matrix data (each row of matrix contains one
%           observation).
%       NumNodes is desired number of nodes. If NumNodes is array then
%           number of nodes in calculated graph is not greater than
%           sum(NumNodes). For more details see Several epoch strategies
%           below.
%       ParameterSet is special function to define parameters of
%           algorithm. There are two standard functions:
%               parametersPrincipalCurve.m
%               parametersPrincipalCircle.m
%           Detailed description of each listed function is included into
%           corresponding m files. Description of parameters function
%           development is included into all listed files and to WIKI???
%           If you use parameterFunction with several epoches then see
%           Several epoch strategies below.
%   By default computeElasticPrincipalGraph also prepare tree figures:
%       "Accuracy/Complexity plot" shows the dependence of the normalized
%           geometrical complexity on the number of nodes. This graph is
%           very useful to find optimal number of nodes. You can produce
%           this graph later by function
%           accuracyComplexityPlot(ReportTable) 
%       "PCA view on principal tree" shows the projection of a principal
%           graph onto the first two principal components of the data. In
%           other words this graph is visualisation of data and graph. You
%           can produce this graph later by function PCAView.
%       "MSE and Elastic energy plot" shows the dynamics of data
%           approximation and elastic energy term during principal tree
%           construction. You can produce this graph later by function
%           plotMSDEnergyPlot(ReportTable).
%
%   [NodePositions, Edges, ReportTable] = 
%           computeElasticPrincipalGraph(data, NumNodes, ParameterSet)
%       returns also ReportTable. Report table is table with 16 columns:
%           BARCODE is barcode in form ...S4|S3||N, where N is number of
%               nodes, S3 is number of three stars, S4 (5,...) is number of
%               four (five,...) stars.
%           ENERGY is total energy of graph embedment (ENERGY = MSE + UE +
%               UR)
%           NNODES is number of nodes.
%           NEDGES is number of edges (NEDGES = NNODES - 1).
%           NRIBS is number of two stars (nodes with two otherr connected
%               nodes). 
%           NSTARS is number of stars with 3 and more leaves (nodes
%               connected with central node). 
%           NRAYS2 is sum of rays minus doubled number of nodes.
%           MSE is mean square error or assessment of data approximation
%               quality.
%           MSEP is mean square error of data approximation when the data points are
%               projected to edges rather than graph nodes
%           FVE is fraction of explained variance. This value always
%               between 0 and 1. Greater value means higher quality of
%               data approximation.
%           FVEP is the fraction of explained variance, when the projection
%               of a data point is computed on an edge of the graph and not
%               a node.
%           UE is elastic energy for edges stretching.
%           UR is elastic energy of deviation from harmonicity.
%           URN is UR * nodes 
%           URN2 is UR * nodes^2
%           URSD is standard deviation of UR???
%
%   [...] = computeElasticPrincipalGraph(data,NumNodes,'PARAM1',val1, ...)
%       specifies optional parameter name/value pairs to control the
%       computation. Parameters are: 
%       'Lamdba' is coefficient of elastic stretching of the graph. Coefficient
%           is positive double number. If EP is vector then see Several
%           epoch strategies below.
%       'Mu' is penalty coefficient for deviation from harmonicity.
%           Coefficient is positive double number. If RP is vector then see
%           Several epoch strategies below.
%       'BranchingControl' controls behaviour of the graph for branching
%           The parameter should be a pair of real numbers: [alpha beta]
%           The elasticity of an edge at the graph selection stage 
%           becomes \lambda+\alpha*(k-2), where k
%           is the maximum star order to which the edge belongs. 
%           Thus, higher alpha penalizes appearance of higher order stars.
%           The value of alpha does not affect the optimization of a given 
%           graph structure.
%           The recommended default value for alpha is 0.01.
%           Values of alpha bigger than 0.5 should effectively forbid any
%           branching: thus, forcing construction of a principal curve
%           instead of a tree.
%           The value of beta remains experimental and currently should be
%           set to 1
%       'TrimmingRadius' is robust or trimming radius. To perform non robust
%           algorithm specify TrimmingRadius = 0. 
%       'InitGraph' is structure with two elements: InitNodes and
%           InitEdges. This parameter can be used for continuation of graph
%           construction:
%               % firstly create very harmonic graph
%               [NodePositions, Edges] = ...
%                       computeElasticPrincipalTree(data,10,'RP'=1);
%               % continue for more flexible graph
%               [NodePositions, Edges] = ...
%                       computeElasticPrincipalTree(data,10,'RP'=0.1,...
%                       'InitGraph',struct('InitNodes',NodePositions,...
%                       'InitEdges',Edges));
%       'ReduceDimension' is used for dimensionality reduction by
%           principal components. There are tree possible values:
%               Integer value K. This value must be positive integer being
%                   not greater than m (number of columns in matrix data).
%                   In this case the first K principal components will be
%                   used.
%               Array with two integer values [K1, K2].  These value must
%                   be positive integer being not greater than m (number of
%                   columns in matrix data) and inequality K1 <= K2 has to
%                   be held. In this case principal components from K1 to
%                   K2 inclusive will be used.
%               Array with more than 2 elements. All elements  must be
%                   positive integer being not greater than m (number of 
%                   columns in matrix data). These values are considered as
%                   indices of principal components to use.
%       'Plots' is integer number which specifies set of plots to draw:
%           1 for "Accuracy/Complexity plot" 
%           2 for "PCA view on principal graph"
%           4 for "Metro map layout of the principal tree"
%           8 for "MSE and Elastic energy plot"
%           To specify several plots it is necessary to use sum of listed
%           values. For example, for "Accuracy/Complexity plot" and "Metro
%           map layout of the principal tree" i is necessary to use value
%           5 = 1 (Accuracy/Complexity) + 4 (Metro map).
